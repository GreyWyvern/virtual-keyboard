# Javascript Virtual Keyboard

Add a javascript virtual keyboard to text, password, textarea, and number inputs. Good for kiosk use, or to allow convenient input of characters from different languages.

Includes a "User Script" version that can be added to browsers such as Firefox to enable the keyboard on all pages.
